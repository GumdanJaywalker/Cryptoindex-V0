# **HyperIndex TGE Strategy Briefing**

Version: 1.0

Date: October 12, 2025

This document defines the core strategy for the Token Generation Event (TGE) and tokenomics of the HyperIndex protocol. We pursue regulatory compliance and sustainable ecosystem design through a dual-token and sequenced TGE model.

---

## **1) Phase 1: Global Strategy**

### **A. Token Identity & Branding**

- Index DAO (aka “INDEX DAO”) — $HIIN
- DEX DAO — $HIDE

Rationale: The index and DEX protocols possess distinct utilities and user value perceptions (index sectors vs. trading venue). A multi-DAO structure avoids forcing users to assume rights/risks they do not want (e.g., index-only participants bearing DEX governance). It also reduces regulatory complexity that could arise from merging two dissimilar functions into a single foundation. Each DAO has its own legal representative entity.

---

### **B. TGE Timeline & Sequencing**

Phase 0: Closed Beta (Oct 2025 – Nov 2025)

- Operate Closed-Beta protocol without TGE
- Labs-led Closed-Beta mainnet
- Access limited to a small set of KOLs and invitees
- Fundraising: Pre-Seed / Angel
- Only individual index-token DAOs exist
- HyperIndex Labs, Dubai

Phase 1: Official Launch – TGE (Nov 2025 – Dec 2025)

- Dual TGE: $HIIN and $HIDE
    - ***FDV: $HIIN USDC 40M, $HIDE USDC 20M***
    - ***Token Supply: 100B Tokens Each***
- Foundations incorporated in Cayman: HyperIn Foundation (Index), HyperDEX Foundation (DEX)
- Dual DAOs launched
- CEX: One top-tier centralized exchange (budget up to $120k; name disclosed upon confirmation)
- DEX: HyperLiquid HIP-1 Spot Dutch Auction
- DEX: HyperSwap Liquidity Pool deployment
- Market making on DEX/CEX
- 1st Airdrop & Pre-determined Token Allocation
    - Airdrop amount: 5% each (5,000,000,000 tokens each)
- Note: All airdrops described across phases are distributed from within the Community allocation (45%). The 20% total airdrop cap is part of, not in addition to, the 45% bucket. The remaining 25% of the Community bucket is reserved for ecosystem grants and programmatic rewards via DAO governance. If the 25% of the community bucket ran out of tokens, the token for incentives and rewards could be backed by new token minting & protocol revenue treasury. All possible methods can be discussed on each DAOs, and its final determination is held by the DAO of each protocol.

Phase 2: Perps & Chain Expansion & Second Airdrop (Q1–Q2 2026)

- Platform Perps expansion (HIP-3 & native perp DEX via Dutch Auction listing) → strengthens $HIDE
- Full SCV expansion (more base asset chains, more basket assets) → strengthens $HIIN
- 2nd Airdrop & Protocol-upgrade Contribution Allocation
    - Airdrop amount: 10% each (10,000,000,000 tokens each)
    - Protocol-upgrade Contribution Allocation: 5%
- Perps listings for $HIDE and $HIIN
    - CEX: 2 venues among top-tier exchanges (to be disclosed when finalized)
    - DEX: Hyperliquid Perps

Phase 3: RWA Expansion & Third Airdrop (Q3–Q4 2026)

- Platform RWA expansion (RWA-token-based Index Launcher & Trading, incl. perps)
    - Strengthens both $HIIN and $HIDE
- 3rd (final) Airdrop & Protocol-upgrade Contribution Allocation
    - Airdrop amount: 5% each (5,000,000,000 tokens each)
    - Protocol-upgrade Contribution Allocation: 5%
- Broaden CEX footprint toward listings on 5 major exchanges (perps & spot), subject to availability and compliance

Phase 4: Protocol Vault (Q1–Q2 2027)

- Launch Protocol Vault for arbitrage trading
    - Lift MM exclusivity on arbitrage; any user can earn via the Vault module
    - $HIIN: SCV module activity rises with arbitrage volume
    - $HIDE: DEX volume increases likewise
- Protocol-upgrade Contribution Allocation: 5%

Phase 5: Real Estate Token Index Expansion (Q3 2027 onward)

- Real-Estate-token indexing
    - Real-Estate Index Launcher / Trading / Perps
- Protocol-upgrade Contribution Allocation: 5%

---

## **C. Token Synergy Design** *(subject to legal review)*

### **Approach**

The synergy framework between the **Index DAO ($HIIN)** and the **DEX DAO ($HIDE)** is entirely **activity-driven**, with transparent scoring, on-chain tracking, and independent distribution.

Each DAO operates its own **Ecosystem Reward Pool**, distributing its native token on a **1:1 ratio with Contribution Points (1 point = 1 token)**.

No cross-ownership or controlling interest exists between the two DAOs; instead, they cooperate under a legally neutral partnership model focused on mutual growth.

---

### **Plan 1: Activity-Based, Indirect Linkage — Contribution Payments**

Both DAOs periodically reward contributors from the counterpart ecosystem based on measurable, on-chain participation.

### **1) Index Contributors → rewarded in $HIDE (“INDEX Builder Program”)**

The DEX DAO grants **$HIDE** to participants contributing to the Index ecosystem through governance, analytics, or index creation.

| **Category** | **Action** | **Points (≈ Tokens)** | **Rationale** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Governance Mastery** | Submit and pass a HyperIn Proposal (HXP) | 1,000 | Incentivizes governance leadership |
|  | Participate in all HXP votes in the quarter | 100 | Continuous engagement |
|  | Publish a high-rated forum analysis | 50 | Improves discourse quality |
| **Index Accelerator** | Launch a Layer-3 index reaching $100k TVL | 500 | Early-stage validation |
|  | Graduate a Layer-3 index to Layer-2 | 5,000 | Core ecosystem growth milestone |
| **Ecosystem Contribution** | Build analytics tools or dashboards for Index DAO | 300 | Encourages technical participation |

Quarterly distribution: approximately **1,000,000,000 $HIDE** from the DEX DAO’s ecosystem pool.

---

### **2) DEX Contributors → rewarded in $HIIN (“DEX Catalyst Program”)**

The Index DAO allocates **$HIIN** to key contributors supporting DEX growth, liquidity, and trading performance.

| **Category** | **Action** | **Points (≈ Tokens)** | **Rationale** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Pioneer LP** | Provide liquidity to newly graduated Layer-2 index within first 72 hours | 2,000 | Bootstraps early pools |
|  | Early LPs on L1/L3 pairs (weighted by liquidity) | 500–1,000 | Maintains depth and stability |
| **Market Maker** | Achieve top 10% monthly trading volume | 1,000 | Improves trading efficiency |
|  | Tiered fee rebate (non-token) | — | Volume-based incentive |
| **Long-Term Staker** | Stake $HIIN or $HIDE ≥ 12 months | 500 | Strengthens governance continuity |
| **Layer-3 Growth Incentives** | see below | — | Cross-layer growth incentive |

Quarterly distribution: approximately **1,000,000,000 $HIIN**, with parameters governed by DAO consensus.

---

### **Layer-3 Growth Incentives — Funding vs. LP Rounds** *(subject to legal review)*

### **0) Scenario Assumptions & Definitions**

- **Final Price (Pf)**: sticky terminal price at Bonding Curve completion.
- **Bonding Curve Average (Pb)**: average realized sale price during the curve.
- **Bonding Curve Proceeds (Bc)**: total funds raised on the curve.
- **Target NAV**: Pf × **1,000,000,000** tokens.
- **Funding Needed**: Target NAV − Bc.
- **Circuit-Breaker Threshold**: If **market cap at Pf** deviates from **paid-in value** by **≥10%**, **price freezes** and a **Funding Round opens**.
- **Multiple Rounds**: Whenever the ≥10% gap reappears, **a new Funding Round epoch may open** with fresh disclosures.

**Canonical split per epoch (closed-form):**

- **Token-Side requirement (T_amt)** = Pf × **200,000,000**
- **NAV shortfall (N_amt)** = Funding Needed − T_amt = Pf × **800,000,000** − Bc

→ **T_amt** forms the **token-side reserve (LP entitlement)**, **N_amt** is **off-LP NAV correction**.

**Design boundary:** NAV correction is **off-LP**. Only the **200M token side** forms the AMM’s token reserve. **LP entitlement arises solely from T-LP.**

---

### **1) Funding Round (per epoch) — Single Round, Two Internal Uses**

| **Bucket** | **Purpose** | **Source of Amount** | **Redeemability** | **LP Entitlement** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **T-LP (Token-Side LP)** | Build token-side reserve for **200M** tokens (Layer-2 AMM) | **T_amt = Pf × 200M** | LP token (short lock) | **Yes** |
| **NAV Participation** | Off-LP purchase of underlying basket to back **800M** curve-sold tokens | **N_amt = Pf × 800M − Bc** | Non-redeemable | **No** |

**Contributor receipts (in a Funding Round epoch):**

- **T-LP portion** → pro-rata **LP tokens** (token side), short lock (e.g., 30–90d), **earns LP fees**.
- **NAV portion** → **no LP**; compensated via native incentives + protocol-level revenue share (below).

**Trigger cadence:** Circuit-breaker (≥10% gap) **→** open Funding Round (epoch **k**) **→** disclose params **→** settle T_amt/N_amt **→** unfreeze upon resolution. Repeatable.

---

### **2) LP Round — Quote-Side Liquidity (Always-Open)**

- **What:** Separate, **always-open** facility to add **USDC or HYPE quote-side** liquidity.
- **Rights:** **LP tokens (quote side)**; fully **redeemable**; **earns LP fees**.
- **Token incentives:** **0 pt by default** (redeemable & fee-earning). If depth is strategically required, DAO may authorize a **time-boxed micro-boost ≤0.5 pt per $**, hard-capped.

---

### **3) Reward Parameters (1 point = 1 token, paid in $HIDE)**

All emissions are sourced from the **DEX DAO community pool**, under **per-index sub-caps** and **on-chain schedules**. Parameters apply **per Funding Round epoch**.

| **Action / Bucket** | **Reward Rate** | **Token** | **Notes / Rationale** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **NAV Participation (Funding Round)** | **10 pt per $1** | $HIDE | Non-redeemable, system-critical backing; strengthened vs. TGE baseline (e.g., $0.02) |
| **Graduation Bonus (NAV only)** | **+1 pt per $1** (upon L2 graduation) | $HIDE | Success-aligned kicker |
| **Governance Boost (NAV only)** | **veHIDE 2× for 12 months** | — | Long-term alignment for NAV backers |
| **Protocol Fee Revenue Share (NAV only)** | **10% of Protocol Fee on that Index Token** for 6–12 months, pro-rata; with a hard cap (governance) | — | Protocol-level share (not Creator/LP fees) |
| **T-LP (Token-Side, Funding Round)** | **2 pt per $1** | $HIDE | Redeemable LP but partial effectiveness sacrificed during NAV fix → modest incentive |
| **LP Round (Quote-Side, always-open)** | **0 pt** (default) / **≤0.5 pt** (DAO-optional, time-boxed) | $HIDE | Fee-earning; boosts only when depth is strategically needed |

---

### **4) Controls, Legal Posture & Disclosures**

- **Anti-gaming:** linked-wallet/wash-trade detection → point forfeiture/slash; per-wallet caps; epoch cool-downs.
- **Performance gates:** unspent NAV rewards **expire/burn** if graduation fails.
- **Independence:** All $HIDE programs are executed **solely by the DEX Foundation** as **marketing/activation**; no cross-treasury commingling or control with the Index Foundation.
- **Mandatory on-chain pre-disclosures (per epoch):** Pf, Pb, Bc, Funding Needed, computed **T_amt/N_amt**, locks/vesting, emission caps/schedules, and **Protocol Fee Revenue Share** parameters.

**Rationale (concise):**

- The **≥10% circuit-breaker** preserves NAV integrity and allows **multiple Funding Round epochs** as needed.
- **Off-LP NAV** separation keeps accounting clean; **LP entitlement** is strictly confined to **T-LP**.
- Incentives are **risk-weighted** (NAV strongest) while **LP Round** remains market-driven with minimal or tactical token spend.

### **Summary of Quantitative Parameters**

| **Parameter** | **Value** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Point-to-Token Rate** | 1 point = 1 token | Applies universally to $HIIN and $HIDE |
| **Quarterly Reward Pool (each DAO)** | 10,000,000 tokens | Adjustable by DAO vote |
| **Funding Round Reward Basis** | 1 point = 1 $HIDE (+Graduation Bonus) | Proportional to contribution amount |
| **Governance Boost (Funding Participants)** | 2× veHIDE for 12 months | Temporary voting weight incentive |
| **Graduation Developer Fee** | Up to 80% of trading fee | For Layer-3 creators post-graduation |
- *Legal Positioning (for all Programs): Each foundation can characterize these distributions as independent customer acquisition/marketing toward power users in a partner ecosystem. Programs are opt-in or activity-based and do not create ownership/control ties.*

---

Plan 2: Opt-In Joint Incentive Program

- Execution: The DEX Foundation launches a Synergy Boosting Program. Users stake $HIIN in the program contract to opt in and then receive $HIDE rewards or DEX fee discounts.
- Legal Framing: This is not a unilateral airdrop but an opt-in contract with user assent. The DEX Foundation may deem $HIIN a “friendly asset” and independently incentivize staking to enhance the DEX ecosystem.

Plan 3: Formal Partnership between Foundations (subject to counsel)

- Example: A “Joint Ecosystem Activation & Marketing Partnership” agreement where INDEX DAO, via vote, authorizes sharing a $HIIN holder list for marketing purposes, and the DEX Foundation pays consideration or commits to reciprocal obligations.
- Legal Framing: The relationship is contractual and non-controlling. Agreements must avoid terms implying dominance or de-facto common enterprise.

Independence Clause (applies to all synergy sections above):

All synergy/incentive programs are independently designed and executed by each DAO/foundation. No control, subordination, or common-enterprise relationship is created by any program described herein.

---

### **D. Consolidated Legal & Foundation Structure (subject to counsel)**

- For-profit dev company (Dubai) and non-profit foundations (Cayman) are separated.
- Rationale: Clear role separation reduces regulatory risk. The dev company is framed as an IT development firm, while the foundations act as administrators of decentralized protocols, optimizing jurisdictional advantages and distributing risk.

---

### **E. Treasury Structure — Clarified**

HyperIndex maintains two distinct treasuries with different purposes and sources:

1. Foundation Strategic Reserve
- Source: 15% of the native tokens ($HIIN, $HIDE) allocated at TGE as initial strategic capital.
- Use: Subject to DAO approval, for long-term strategic activities (token swaps for major partnerships, ecosystem grants, crisis response). Designed as a token reserve with prudent vesting.
1. Protocol Revenue Treasury
- Source: Real operating fee revenues (e.g., HYPE, USDC) generated by protocol usage.
- Use: Supports real yield and operating expenses; may be distributed to stakers as dividends (real yield) in the future.

---

## **2) Token-Specific Plans**

### **I. HyperIndex INDEX Token ($HIIN)**

### **A. Tokenomics (Finalized)**

- Target FDV: $40,000,000
- Total Supply: 100,000,000,000 $HIIN

| **Allocation** | **% of Total Supply** | **Lockup & Vesting** | **Rationale** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Community/Ecosystem (incl. Airdrops) | 45% | TGE 5% unlocked, 60 months | “5-year sustainability.” Continuous incentives to nurture durable growth. All airdrops (total 20%) are drawn from this 45% cap. |
| Investors | 15% | 6-month cliff, 24 months | Budget for all rounds (Pre-seed/Seed/Series A) within a fixed 15% cap; transparent maximum dilution. |
| Team | 15% | 12-month cliff, 36 months | Aligns long-term commitment with project success. |
| Foundation Treasury | 15% | 12-month cliff, 60 months | Strategic reserve for unforeseen needs/partnerships; longer lock ensures prudence. |
| Initial Liquidity | 10% | TGE 50% unlocked, 12 months | Ensure smooth post-TGE trading on DEX/CEX. |

### **B. Core Utility**

- Governance: Propose/vote (new indexes, rule changes) via staking.
- Economic Benefits: Stakers receive $HIIN from the ecosystem reward pool (initial model excludes re-staking).
- Ecosystem Utility: Index holders receive rebates (management/rebalancing fees) in $HIIN based on $HIIN staking tiers.

### **C. Airdrop Design**

- Strategy: Hybrid — a strong 1st-wave at TGE for market impact, then ongoing smaller waves to drive persistent contribution.
- Target Groups (weights) & rationale:
    - Hyperliquid & power users of major DEX/CEX (50%) — technically prepared early community; vampire-attack growth targeting active traders and LPs.
    - On-chain asset-management/strategy protocol users (25%) — closest product-market adjacency to $HIIN (Index Coop, Set, Yearn, Reserve DTF, SSI, etc.).
    - HyperIndex Beta participants (25%) — early believers without guaranteed monetary rewards.

Airdrop cap statement: The aggregate 20% (5% + 10% + 5%) is part of the 45% Community allocation, not in addition to it. The remaining 25% of Community is reserved for grants and programmatic rewards via DAO votes.

---

### **II. HyperIndex DEX Token ($HIDE)**

### **A. Tokenomics (Finalized)**

- Target FDV: $20,000,000
- Total Supply: 100,000,000,000 $HIDE
- Structure: Same allocation ratios as $HIIN. Vesting differs for Community as an intentional design choice (see table).

| **Allocation** | **%** | **Lockup & Vesting** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Community/Ecosystem (incl. Airdrops) | 45% | TGE 5% unlocked, 60 months |
| Investors | 15% | 6-month cliff, 24 months |
| Team | 15% | 12-month cliff, 36 months |
| Foundation Treasury | 15% | 12-month cliff, 60 months |
| Initial Liquidity | 10% | TGE 50% unlocked, 12 months |

(If DAO chooses to harmonize with $HIIN later, the Community vesting can be amended via governance.)

### **B. Core Utility**

- Governance: Vote on DEX policies (fees, new features).
- Reward Portfolio:
    - LP rewards (liquidity mining):
        - Layer-3 Launchpad (Bonding Curve) → Hype single-sided LP earns 50% (share of AMM pool fees) + supplemental $HIDE.
        - Other pools (L1/L2) → LPs on Hype – index token pairs get 100% baseline pool rewards.
    - Staking Rewards: $HIDE governance rewards (initial model excludes re-staking).
    - (Optional) Trading Rewards: To stimulate volume.
    - Funding Round contributors earn $HIDE, but cannot double-dip with Hype single-sided LP rewards for the same round.
        - They receive:
            - Index-token ownership (incl. NAV) — Round 1 lowest entry; Round 3 highest
            - Index-token LP fees — aligned with the above (Hype or $HIDE)
            - $HIDE incentives — Round 1 highest; Round 3 lowest

No double-dipping rule (clarified): For the same address, same round, and same contributed amount, Funding rewards and LP incentives are mutually exclusive. Priority order: Funding → LP. Enforcement: snapshot at block N.

### **C. Airdrop Design**

- Target Groups (weights) & rationale:
    - Hyperliquid & power users of major DEX/CEX (50%) — identical rationale to $HIIN.
    - $HIIN stakers (20%) — forge synergy; reward long-term $HIIN holders with $HIDE to seed initial DEX governance.
    - Early DEX LPs (20%) — liquidity is existential for a DEX.
    - Early DEX Users/Traders (10%) — to jump-start market activity.

---

## **3) Forward Development**

- Key Objective: Keep the initial model simple, then evolve rewards for sustainability.
- Roadmap: Post-TGE, develop esToken and veToken models to eliminate “free-rider” rewards and deepen alignment.

---

## **4) Tokenomics — Monetary Flows & Sinks**

Goal: Grow protocol revenues. Burns may be added later via buy-backs or locking of protocol revenue.

### **$HIIN**

- Fees: Index Launcher Fee / Index Rebalancing Fee / Index Management Fee
- Gas: All gas for rebalancing & operations (e.g., HyperEVM swaps) payable in $HIIN (or HYPE)
- Discounts: Paying these fees in $HIIN is cheaper (rebates flow to Revenue Treasury). If paid in HYPE, proceeds still accrue to the Revenue Treasury.
- Buy-backs & Locking: All the tokens that had flow into Revenue Treasury, is converted to $HIIN and locked quarterly for 60months vesting periods.
    - If inflow is done with $HYPE / $USDC / etc, Revenue Treasury quarterly swaps them into $HIIN, buy-back.

### **$HIDE**

- DEX Fees: Fee unit (burnable)
- Gas: DEX gas unit for swaps (payable in $HIDE or HYPE)
- Discounts: Paying gas/fees in $HIDE is cheaper; in either case, revenues accrue to Revenue Treasury.
- Buy-backs & Locking: All the tokens that had flow into Revenue Treasury, is converted to $HIDE and locked quarterly for 60months vesting periods.
    - If inflow is done with $HYPE / $USDC / etc, Revenue Treasury quarterly swaps them into $HIDE, buy-back.

---

## **5) Anti-Sybil & Anti-Gaming Rules (applies to all point-based programs)**

- Real-use weighting: Duration-weighted staking/LP, realized PnL, slippage improvement, order quality.
- Cool-downs & decay: Activity scores decay; cool-downs after grant claims.
- Penalties: Detected wash/self-trading, circular liquidity routing, inorganic TVL → score nullification and slashing of pending rewards.
- Data sources: On-chain proofs + audited indexer/oracle feeds; cross-venue heuristics where applicable.
- Governance transparency: Scoring formulas, thresholds, and detection rules published prior to each epoch.

---

## **6) Annex — TGE Execution & Post-Listing**

### **A. Execution & Listings**

- Contracts: Deploy mainnet contracts; mint total supplies; distribute to vesting contracts and allocation recipients.
- Initial Liquidity: Create pools on HyperIndex DEX and the designated top-tier CEX (name disclosed upon finalization); supply LP.
- Market Making: Professional MM goes live at listing.
- Public Announcement: Simultaneous TGE/listing announcement on official channels.
- Initial Circulating Supply & Price Band: To be finalized and disclosed prior to TGE, including:
    - Initial circulating % and token count by category
    - Dutch Auction parameters (min/max price, decay function, duration, allocation/refund rules)
    - LP pool sizes, pairs, and lockups
    - Vesting contract addresses (to be published)

### **B. Post-TGE Management**

- Airdrop Support & Monitoring: Guides and CS for smooth claiming.
- Community & IR: Regular updates/AMAs; rapid response to FUD/rumors.
- On-chain Analytics: Track holder count, distribution health, whale wallets, and program efficacy.
