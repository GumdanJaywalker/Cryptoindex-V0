# Codex Playbook ‚Äî Hyperindex Frontend

Purpose: a lightweight, actionable handoff so we can resume work in seconds across sessions/agents.

## Snapshot
- App: Hyperindex ‚Äî spot-based memecoin index perps exchange
- Focus: Trading UI, type-safety, and performance polish
- Tooling: Next.js 15, React 19, motion/framer-motion 12, TS 5, Tailwind

## Landing ‚Äî Current Status (2025-09)
- Hero: minimal CTA-only (no headline/subtext), primary ‚ÄúStart Trading‚Äù + secondary ‚ÄúView Indices‚Äù.
- KPI strip: Daily Volume, TVL, Active Indices, Top Gainer (mockMarketStats).
- Trending Indices: table layout with symbol/name, price, 24h%, volume, mcap, actions; deterministic thumbnails via picsum seed.
- Top Traders (landing): hybrid layout ‚Äî podium (ü•á/ü•à/ü•â cards) + ranked list from #4; 24H focus; index chips deep-link to `/trading?index=...`.
- Traders page: same podium on page 1 + paginated table; filters/sort/search; mockTopTraders length expanded to 80.
- Governance: copy simplified to time‚Äëweighted snapshot and operator signatures 4/4; commit/reveal removed; badges/filters have tooltips.
- Portfolio: Creator Earnings tab added (summary, per-index, payouts; policy copy states creator/influencer‚Äëonly).
- Bugfix: React Hooks order in governance detail stabilized.

## Recent Changes ‚Äî Sep 2025
- Landing
  - Hero: headline/subtext removed; CTAs: Start Trading, Create Index, View Indices.
  - KPI strip (Daily Volume, TVL, Active Indices, Top Gainer); numbers from `mockMarketStats`.
  - Layout: three panels with internal scroll (sidebar/indices/top traders), sidebar right divider, unified +/- colors (green/red), removed sidebar search and Portfolio‚Äôs Start Trading button.
- Top Traders
  - Landing: podium (1/2/3) + rich two‚Äëline rows from #4; 24H ROI/$PnL; index chips ‚Üí `/trading?index=...`; removed crown icon.
  - Traders page: same podium on page 1; table converted to rich rows; rank numbering fixed (continues from #4 on page 1, page‚Äëaware otherwise); mock trader count ‚Üí 80.
- Trending Indices
  - Deterministic thumbnails via picsum seed; Quick View modal (IndexDetailModal) + Trade button in actions.
- Governance
  - Time‚Äëweighted snapshot + Operator 4/4 copy; removed commit/reveal; badges/tooltips aligned.
- Earnings
  - Portfolio CreatorEarnings: added Creator Fee vs LP Fee breakdown card (mock split).
  - Create Index overview: Earnings split into Creator Fee and LP Fee (accrued/projected slots).
- Referrals
  - New `/referrals` route with Influencer/KOLs vs Individual tabs, tier label (Partner 0/Individual 0), referral code/link copy, metrics and earnings breakdown.
- Infra/UX
  - Link fixes for ‚ÄúView Leaderboard‚Äù; background effects set to `pointer-events-none`; Vercel Preview env guidance.

## Dev Guidelines (FE)
- Package manager: pnpm only. Use `pnpm install`, `pnpm dev`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm start`, `pnpm lint`.
- Language: UI text, comments, identifiers in English; keep copy concise and neutral.
- Communication (agents): When replying in Korean, always use polite/formal speech (Ï°¥ÎåìÎßê). Avoid casual/informal tone.
- Brand colors (updated)
  - Primary (soft mint): `#98FCE4`
  - Background/dark teal (near‚Äëblack): `#072723`
  - Light mint‚Äëgray (neutrals): `#D7EAE8`
  - Use utilities defined in `app/globals.css` (`text-brand`, `bg-brand`, `border-brand`, `bg-brand-hover`, `bg-brand-gradient`). Keep the default dark theme; prefer subtle gradients and minimal glow.
- UI style: Hyperliquid-like density; chart+orderbook+trading panel tri-column on desktop; reduce on tablet/mobile.
- TypeScript: strict typing; client hooks/components use DOM timer types (no `NodeJS.Timeout`).
- Imports/paths: use `@/*` alias; keep components colocated by feature.
- Package hygiene: do not add libs without need; align with shadcn/Radix, MagicUI, Tailwind.
- For full environment details, see `CLAUDE.md`.

## Current Priorities
1) Mobile/accessibility/perf pass (focus outlines, prefers‚Äëreduced‚Äëmotion, image optimization)
2) Trending polish (badges: NEW/HOT; Quick View/Trade hover; minmax grid gutters)
3) Referrals polish (metrics granularity; creator whitelist states; link analytics)

## Governance ‚Äî Implementation Plan (UI + Policy)
- Types: add `lib/types/governance.ts` for Proposal, VotingConfig, Tally, SnapshotInfo, MultisigState, TimelockInfo, UserState, ChangeSet, Option.
- State/Hooks: add `lib/store/governance-store.ts`, `hooks/use-governance.ts`, `hooks/use-snapshot-power.ts`, `hooks/use-commit-reveal.ts`, `hooks/use-timelock.ts`.
- API Stubs: `lib/api/governance.ts` with getProposals/getTally/getSnapshotPower/getTimelock/getMultisig.
- Layout: in `components/governance/GovernanceLayout.tsx` add tabs/filters for states: Active, Commit, Reveal, Queued (Timelock), Awaiting Multisig, Executed, Failed. Add policy banner (Snapshot/Quorum/Timelock/Multisig/Shielded Voting).
- Dashboard: replace mocks with hook data; show Snapshot block/time-window, Quorum progress, Pass threshold, Timelock countdown, Multisig signatures.
- Rebalancing Section: group by state, add filters and real refresh; cards consume hooks instead of hardcoded arrays.
- Rebalancing Card: add badges for Snapshot method, Quorum progress (currentPower/totalSnapshotPower), Pass Threshold; enforce commit‚Üíreveal flow when enabled; show Timelock ETA and Multisig signatures after success; guard buttons for eligibility and phase.
- Battle Section/Cards: either remove or reframe as ‚Äúweight decision battles‚Äù consistent with rebalancing; surface the same policy badges.
- Voting Power Manager (new): explain snapshot methods (single, time-weighted, lock-based, multi-point, commit-reveal), show lock-based weighting UX when applicable.
- Copy/i18n: centralize governance texts in `lib/constants/governanceCopy.ts` (optional).
- Tests (light): calculate quorum/threshold, timelock ETA, snapshot eligibility; component snapshots for key phases.
- tsconfig: include new files; DOM-first typing for client hooks.

Policy notes (from business plan):
- Snapshot voting power to prevent whale attacks; optionally time-weighted or lock-based (ve) as future modes.
- Quorum as minimum participation; surface but don‚Äôt over-rely due to whale concentration risk.
- Timelock after pass; provide cancel window and review.
- Multisig M-of-N required for sensitive execution (e.g., rebalancing), then on-chain execution and audit trail.
- Optional shielded voting (Shutter/commit-reveal) to reduce early herding.

## Create Page ‚Äî Index Builder (User-Created Index)
- Route: `app/create/page.tsx` (Create Index). Wizard-style flow with autosave.
- Steps (UI):
  1) Basics: name, symbol, description, category, icon.
  2) Chain/Settlement: chain fixed to L3, settlement token, fee currency.
  3) Rules: weight caps (max per asset), min-liquidity threshold, inclusion filters (no rebalance on L3).
  4) Constituents: search/select assets, assign weights under rule caps, blacklist applied.
  5) Simulation: backtest summary, slippage/liquidity checks, gas/bridging estimate.
  6) Review & Submit: summary, risk warnings, submit for governance.
- Components:
  - `components/create/IndexBuilderWizard.tsx`: orchestrates steps.
  - `components/create/AssetPicker.tsx`: multi-chain asset selector with liquidity/price info.
  - `components/create/WeightTable.tsx`: weights with validation, sum=100%, caps.
  - `components/create/RuleEditor.tsx`: rebalancing rules and constraints.
  - `components/create/BacktestPreview.tsx`: simple mock charts first; pluggable data source later.
  - `components/create/DeployPanel.tsx`: shows deployment plan, fees, confirmations.
- Hooks/APIs:
  - `hooks/use-index-builder.ts`: local state with schema validation (zod), autosave to localStorage.
  - `lib/api/indexes.ts` (stubs): resolve assets, quote mint/redeem, simulate rebalance; later connect to onchain/AP.
- Backend-owned touchpoints (not FE scope):
  - Token Creation/Redemption (AP), mint/redeem quotes, basket validation.
  - Multi-chain messaging/settlement (LayerZero), wallet infra.
  - FE only prepares spec and displays statuses returned by APIs.
- Governance interplay (FE scope):
  - ‚ÄúRequest Governance Review‚Äù to send the built spec to backend; FE tracks proposal status via governance hooks.
  - No direct deploy UX on FE; show read-only status (Queued/Timelock/Awaiting Multisig/Executed) from API.

MVP scope (frontend-only):
- Full wizard UX with strict validation, local persistence, simple mock sim (optional).
- No onchain deploy or chain messaging in FE.
- Provide JSON export of index spec and a "Request Governance Review" action only.

## Create ‚Äî Progress Snapshot
- Completed:
  - Route `/create` + header link
  - Wizard steps and per-step validation with blocked navigation on errors
  - Autosave UX: ‚ÄúSaving‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúSaved 1m ago‚Äù (relative time + tooltip)
  - Basics: category select with ‚ÄúOther‚Äù custom input
  - Chain fixed to L3 (read-only), settlement/fee token selects (USDC/USDT)
  - Constituents: modal AssetPicker (search, scrolling, sorting by volume/return/liquidity/symbol), filters (hide low liq, exclude blacklist, positive return only), ‚ÄúSelected N‚Äù counter, Clear all
  - WeightTable: 1% step select per asset, hard cap by remaining %, Normalize/Distribute equally, per-asset remove (X)
  - Review: human-readable summary, error list, ‚ÄúGo to first error‚Äù + section ‚ÄúEdit‚Äù buttons, submit disabled until valid
  - Creator overview/earnings cards (mock)
- Next (to finish Create MVP):
  - Micro feedback on actions (Normalize/Distribute): brief ‚ÄúAll set ‚úì‚Äù confirmation
  - Submit stub: POST to backend endpoint with spec; success/failure toast
  - Modal filter: ‚ÄúSelected only‚Äù toggle
- Later (optional polish):
  - Virtualized list for very large catalogs
  - Backend blacklist integration (disable with reason)
  - Simple simulation cards (mock backtest/liquidity checks)

## Governance ‚Äî Progress Snapshot (2025-09-04)
- Foundation:
  - Types: `lib/types/governance.ts` (Proposal, phases, snapshot/quorum/timelock/multisig/shielded)
  - Store: `lib/store/governance-store.ts` (Zustand load/getById)
  - API stubs: `lib/api/governance.ts` ‚Üí `getProposals()`, `submitIndexSpec()`
  - Hook: `hooks/use-governance.ts` (quorumReached, supportPercent, passReached, timeLeft)
- UI (policy-first, new components):
  - `components/governance/ProposalsSection.tsx`: filterable list (All/Active/Ending Soon/Queued/Awaiting Multisig/Executed)
  - `components/governance/ProposalCard.tsx`: Snapshot badge, Quorum/Support bars, Time-left, Changes, Multisig progress; action tooltips by phase (commit/reveal/timelock/multisig/active)
  - Layout: `GovernanceLayout` now renders ProposalsSection + policy caption
  - Dashboard: policy summary cards (Snapshot modes, Quorum range, Timelock, Multisig)
- Policy decision: Snapshot method = Time‚ÄëWeighted only
  - Rationale: strong manipulation resistance, low liquidity constraint, medium implementation
  - Scope change: lock‚Äëbased / sliding window / commit‚Äëreveal / multi‚Äëpoint are out of scope for MVP
  - UI: show ‚ÄúSnapshot: Time‚ÄëWeighted‚Äù; do not surface other modes in badges or copy
  - Data: proposals will use `snapshot.method = 'time-weighted'`

### Snapshot Method ‚Äî Finalized for MVP
- Time‚Äëweighted (only): high manipulation resistance; medium long‚Äëterm incentive; medium implementation; low liquidity constraint

Notes
- Other methods (lock‚Äëbased, sliding window, commit‚Äëreveal, multi‚Äëpoint) are excluded from MVP and must not be exposed in UI.

## 2025-09-04 ‚Äî Status and Next
- Done today:
  - Create: rules-before-assets reordering, L3 fixed chain; modal AssetPicker with search/sort/filters; global blacklist UX; WeightTable with 1% caps; micro feedback; virtualized grid; submit stub + toasts; hydration-safe draft loading.
  - Governance: types/store/hook/API stubs; proposals section/cards with policy badges; dashboard policy summary; time‚Äëweighted snapshot finalized; detail page `/governance/[id]` with quorum/support/time/changes/timelock/multisig; timelock countdown + urgency; voter breakdown (percent + absolute) + tooltips; list/card ‚ÄúQueued soon‚Äù badge; list/time urgency color.
- Next (short term ‚Äî feature only):
  - Backend integration
    - Wire list/detail to real endpoints
    - Snapshot power (time‚Äëweighted) endpoint for eligibility/voting power
    - Tallies/timelock/multisig polling or SSE
  - Tests (helpers)
    - quorum/support/timeLeft calculations
- Later (integration):
  - Hook API wiring to real backend/indexer; snapshot power endpoint; timelock/multisig status
  - (Removed) Shielded voting flows (commit/reveal) ‚Äî not in MVP
  - Lightweight tests for helpers (quorum/support/timeLeft)

## Dev Plan Update ‚Äî Time‚ÄëWeighted Only (MVP)
- UI/Copy
  - Snapshot badge and captions: always ‚ÄúSnapshot: Time‚ÄëWeighted‚Äù
  - Remove/hide any references to lock‚Äëbased/sliding/commit‚Äëreveal/multi‚Äëpoint
- Data/Mocks
  - Update all proposal stubs to `snapshot.method = 'time-weighted'`
  - Remove commit/reveal phases from samples; use `active/queued/timelocked/awaiting-multisig/executed`
- Code Simplification (post‚ÄëMVP polish)
  - Narrow `SnapshotMethod` union to `'time-weighted'` or keep others behind comments
  - Simplify `snapshotLabel` helpers and UI branches
  - Ensure eligibility/tooltips reference time‚Äëweighted rules only

## Policy Update ‚Äî Multisig (Operator‚ÄëOnly, 4/4)
- Execution is gated by operator signatures, not a public multisig threshold.
- Exactly 4 of 4 operator signatures are required to execute rebalancing.
- UI Changes:
  - Replace generic ‚ÄúMultisig M‚Äëof‚ÄëN‚Äù with ‚ÄúOperator signatures 4/4 required‚Äù.
  - Action tooltips: ‚ÄúOperator‚Äëonly‚Äù for non‚Äësigners.
  - Detail view highlights ‚ÄúYou are signer‚Äù for connected operator addresses.
- Data/Mocks:
  - Set `config.multisig = { m: 4, n: 4 }` in all proposals; adjust `multisig.signed` accordingly.

## Resume Checklist ‚Äî Governance (next agent)
- Environment
  - Run dev: `pnpm dev` ‚Üí visit `/governance` and `/governance/[id]`
  - Data source: mock via `lib/api/governance.ts` (`getProposals`, time‚Äëweighted only)
- Immediate next tasks (priority)
  1) Backend integration (replace mocks)
     - GET `/api/governance/proposals` (list)
     - GET `/api/governance/proposals/:id` (detail)
     - GET `/api/governance/proposals/:id/tally`
     - GET `/api/governance/proposals/:id/snapshot-power?address=0x...`
     - GET `/api/governance/proposals/:id/timelock`
     - GET `/api/governance/proposals/:id/multisig`
  2) Error/empty states
     - Verify list/detail fallbacks with real endpoints
- Integration prep
  - Define API contracts: snapshot power (time‚Äëweighted), tallies, timelock, multisig signer set
  - Error/empty states: add fallbacks in list/detail when API errors or returns 0 items

## Resume Checklist ‚Äî Create
- Validation checklist card on Review (required fields summary)
- Normalize messages/toasts (success/failure) and align copy
- Keep: AssetPicker virtual grid, global blacklist, 1% caps, hydration‚Äësafe drafts

## Next Tasks (Queue)
- CTA: add ‚ÄúCreate Index‚Äù next to ‚ÄúStart Trading‚Äù in hero.
- Sidebar: remove ‚ÄúStart Trading‚Äù button from Portfolio card.
- Scroll/structure: make sidebar, indices, and top traders scrollable within their panels; add a single divider to visually separate sidebar.
- Trending: add NEW/HOT badges, quick view + trade hover actions; minmax grid to avoid uneven gutters.
- Top Traders (list): convert table rows to two‚Äëline rich rows with index chips and 24H $PnL; keep ranking from #4.
- QA: Lighthouse 90+ for performance and accessibility; consistent microcopy (English, concise, neutral).

- Referrals Page
  - Single page with user‚Äëtype switch: Influencer/KOLs vs Individual.
  - Show referral tier text (e.g., ‚ÄúPartner 0‚Äù / ‚ÄúIndividual 0‚Äù), referral code/links, basic metrics.
  - No public program UI; only for approved creators per business policy.

- Earnings Integration (Creator Fee & LP Fee)
  - Portfolio and Create flows: clearly separate ‚ÄúCreator Fee‚Äù (index token fees share) and ‚ÄúLP Fee‚Äù (liquidity pool trading fees).
  - Use mock data first; align with spreadsheet model.
  - Reference: HyperIndex-Revenue Expense Calculator.xlsx (local path).

## Work Queue ‚Äî Concrete Next Steps
- Sidebar polish
  - Adjust scrollbar styles, overscroll‚Äëbehavior, and spacing for smoother chained scroll on desktop/mobile.
- Trending
  - Add NEW/HOT badges on rows; hover actions on entire row (Quick View/Trade) with non‚Äëjanky transitions.
  - Ensure minmax grid to avoid uneven gutters at xl/2xl.
- Top Traders
  - Landing/Traders: add skeletons for podium/list; ensure consistent number formatting; mobile card tweaks.
- Referrals
  - Add header nav link (done); add basic analytics (clicks/signups) charts (mock) and export CSV (mock).
- Earnings
  - Wire to API/spreadsheet model; expose Creator/LP fees per index, per timeframe in Portfolio/Create.
- QA/A11y/Perf
  - Lighthouse ‚â•90, keyboard nav across modals/tabs, prefers‚Äëreduced‚Äëmotion, next/image where applicable.

## Notes
- Communication: when replying in Korean, always use polite/formal speech (Ï°¥ÎåìÎßê). Avoid casual/informal tone.

## Quick File Map
- Governance types: `lib/types/governance.ts`
- Governance API stubs: `lib/api/governance.ts`
- Store: `lib/store/governance-store.ts`
- Hook: `hooks/use-governance.ts`
- List: `components/governance/ProposalsSection.tsx`
- Card: `components/governance/ProposalCard.tsx`
- Dashboard: `components/governance/GovernanceDashboard.tsx`
- Detail: `app/governance/[id]/page.tsx`

## API Contracts (Draft) ‚Äî For Backend Integration

- GET `/api/governance/proposals`
  - Returns: `Proposal[]` (see `lib/types/governance.ts`)
  - Each item should include minimal tally snapshot for list (for/against/abstain, totalSnapshotPower) and phase/config.

- GET `/api/governance/proposals/:id`
  - Returns: full `Proposal` with `tally`, `config`, `timelock`, `multisig`, `user`.

- GET `/api/governance/proposals/:id/tally`
  - Returns: `{ forPower: number; againstPower: number; abstainPower: number; totalSnapshotPower: number }`
  - Time‚Äëweighted snapshot is applied server‚Äëside. FE does not compute.

- GET `/api/governance/proposals/:id/snapshot-power?address=0x...`
  - Returns: `{ eligible: boolean; votingPowerAtSnapshot: number }`

- GET `/api/governance/proposals/:id/timelock`
  - Returns: `{ queuedAt?: number; eta?: number }` (ms epoch)

- GET `/api/governance/proposals/:id/multisig`
  - Returns: `{ required: number; total: number; signed: string[] }`
  - Policy: operator‚Äëonly 4/4 (required=4,total=4). FE shows operator list via static set or from API.

- POST (backend‚Äëonly, FE disabled in MVP)
  - `/api/governance/proposals/:id/vote` ‚Üí body `{ optionIds?: string[] }` (time‚Äëweighted power applied server‚Äëside)
  - `/api/governance/proposals/:id/queue` ‚Üí queues timelock if succeeded
  - `/api/governance/proposals/:id/execute` ‚Üí executes after timelock + 4/4 signatures
  - `/api/governance/proposals/:id/sign` ‚Üí operator signature endpoint
  - Response: `{ ok: true }` or `{ ok: false, error: string }`

Notes
- All numbers are integers in base units. FE formats via `toLocaleString()`.
- Time‚Äëweighted snapshot: definition/version should be included in responses if relevant (e.g., window start/end).
- SSE or polling cadence is acceptable; FE expects eventual consistency on tally/ timelock/ multisig.

## Alignment Review ‚Äî Plan vs Current Repo
- Governance:
  - Current: mock UI, no snapshot/quorum/timelock/multisig/commit-reveal.
  - Action: implement plan above; reframe or remove winner-takes-all ‚ÄúBattle‚Äù.
- Create Page:
  - Current: no `/create` route or builder components.
  - Action: add Create wizard (steps/components/hooks), link from header/nav.
- Token Creation/Redemption (AP):
  - Current: not represented in UI.
  - Action: add stubs in `lib/api/indexes.ts`, surface quotes in Create wizard (mock first).
- Multi-chain & Messaging:
  - Current: not surfaced; wallet integration (Privy) exists.
  - Action: add chain selector and chain-specific asset catalogs in builder; plan LayerZero integration behind API.
- Marketing/Rewards (from doc):
  - Current: governance dashboard shows generic rewards; no referral/partner UI.
  - Action: keep out-of-scope for now; note future routes for referral and partner dashboards.

## Next Actions (concise)
- Add governance types/store/hooks + replace mock arrays in governance components.
- Add Create wizard route and scaffolding with validation and mock data.
- Wire governance policy badges and state gates into cards and dashboard.
- Keep tsconfig scoped and DOM-typed for new hooks/components.

## Task Board
- Task 1 ‚Äî Timer typings in client code
  - Why: Using `NodeJS.Timeout` in browser code causes type friction with DOM timers.
  - Pattern to use (browser-safe):
    - `const timeoutRef = useRef<ReturnType<typeof setTimeout> | null>(null)`
    - Guard before use: `if (timeoutRef.current !== null) clearTimeout(timeoutRef.current)`
    - Assign: `timeoutRef.current = setTimeout(() => { ... }, delay)`
    - Cleanup: `if (timeoutRef.current !== null) { clearTimeout(timeoutRef.current); timeoutRef.current = null }`
    - For RAF: `const rafRef = useRef<number | null>(null)` and `cancelAnimationFrame(rafRef.current)` with null-guards.
  - Files to update (search: `useRef<NodeJS.Timeout`):
    - lib/animations/micro-interactions.tsx
    - hooks/use-realtime.ts (reconnect timeout)
    - hooks/use-gestures.ts (long-press, double-tap)
    - lib/hooks/use-performance.ts (debounce/throttle)
    - components/magicui/particles.tsx (resize timeout)
    - components/ui/placeholders-and-vanish-input.tsx (interval)
    - components/ui/compare.tsx (autoplay)

- Task 2 ‚Äî TS scope stays focused (already mostly done)
  - tsconfig.json is trimmed to trading and core UI; keep it that way during refactor.
  - If DOM vs Node types conflict, prefer DOM. Only add Node types where truly needed (server/middleware).

- Task 3 ‚Äî Small trading UI hygiene
  - Ensure strict equality checks and explicit variant types.
  - Verify exports/imports for `TraderCard` and usage inside `TopTraders`.
  - Keep animated values typed (`number` vs `string`) and cast intentionally only at boundaries.

## Concrete Next Steps (order of execution)
1) Implement Task 1 timer typing pattern in all listed files
   - Commit message: "fix(typings): use DOM-safe timer refs"
2) Run TS check
   - `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`
   - If long, pipe: `| sed -n '1,200p'`
3) Address any remaining trading-scope TS errors (one file at a time)
4) Quick UI sanity in dev (optional)
   - `pnpm dev` and check Trading pages render without console errors

## Coding Notes
- This is a client-first codebase: default to DOM timer types;
  avoid `NodeJS.Timeout` in React components/hooks rendered in the browser.
- `lib` contains mixed client/server utilities; prefer colocating server-only types under clearly excluded paths or add file-level `// server-only` with separate typings if necessary.
- For small effects using timers/RAF, always clear on unmount to avoid leaks.

## tsc Scope (current)
- tsconfig.json includes trading app/components and key UI libs.
- Excludes experimental/duplicate files, demos, middleware, and API during this refactor.

## Quick References
- Trading card: `components/trading/trader-card.tsx`
- Top traders: `components/trading/top-traders.tsx`
- Animations: `lib/animations/micro-interactions.tsx`
- Store: `lib/store/trading-store.ts`

## Resume Checklist
- Run `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`
- Start at the topmost timer-typing error ‚Üí apply the pattern
- Re-run tsc, repeat until clean for trading scope
- Move to Task 3 hygiene items as time allows

## Session Notes
- If another agent picks up: start at Task 1 (file list above). Keep diffs small and re-run tsc between files. If new TS errors appear outside the current scope, prefer expanding excludes rather than widening the refactor in this pass.
