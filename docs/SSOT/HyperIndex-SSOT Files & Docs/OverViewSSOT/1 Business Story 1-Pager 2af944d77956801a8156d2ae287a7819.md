### ⏱️ Elevator Pitch

50-Char: On-chain ETF (IndexToken) Launchpad & DEX on HL.

1-Liner: HyperIndex is the first unified Launchpad & DEX for On-chain ETF (Index Token), built on Hyperliquid L1, enabling permissionless creation and trading of on-chain ETFs with zero gas fees.

---

### 🔭 Vision & Mission

- **Vision:** To make diversified crypto investing as simple and efficient as buying a single asset, establishing the standard infrastructure for the onchain DeFi ETF market.
- **Mission:** To replace the fragmented, manual portfolio management of today with a permissionless, automated ecosystem where anyone can create, trade, and govern index tokens.

### 📖 The Business Story

- **The Problem: [**2. Problem Worth Solving (Problem Definition)**](2%20Problem%20Worth%20Solving%20(Problem%20Definition)%202af944d779568001b3c9d1e9d4131740.md)**
    
    <aside>
    💡
    
    ***Crypto Investing is Fragmented, yet DeFi Lacks Structured Products.***
    
    </aside>
    
    > **The Market is Overwhelming.**
    > 
    - Crypto investing has become unmanageable. Every day, over **50,000 new tokens** are launched across **200+ blockchains**, **120 DEXs**, and **259 CEXs**, each with fragmented liquidity and listings.
    
    > **The "Theme" Gap**
    > 
    - Traders know the "Theme" (e.g., AI, Meme, RWA) is growing, but they fail to identify *which specific token* among thousands will survive. Buying the winner is luck; buying the basket is strategy—but the basket doesn't exist.
    
    > **Structured Product Lakcing in DeFi**
    > 
    - As the **$17.9T TradFi ETF market** proves, "basketed assets" are key to investment efficiency. However, in DeFi, creating a diversified portfolio is painful, because they are forced to build diversified portfolios & manage volatile assets 24/7 manually.
    
    > The Manual Management Pains
    > 
    - Users must manually buy assets, bridge chains, and rebalance portfolios, incurring high gas fees and operational stress. This results in:
        - **Operational Stress:** Manually buying assets, bridging chains, and tracking prices.
        - **High Costs:** Incurring fees for every single transaction and rebalancing event.
    
    > **Existing Solutions are Flawed.**
    > 
    
    Current competitors (e.g., Index Coop, Reserve) operate as centralized **"Asset Managers"** rather than open infrastructure. They fail to solve the problem because they:
    
    - **Act as Gatekeepers:** Centralized governance limits who can launch an index, manage a index and delist it from platform.
    - **Lack Trading Infrastructure:** Relying on external DEXs causes high slippage, fees & de-concentration because they diluted into all other tokens. Or they only provide create <> redemption of each ETF units, which basically are not trading infra.
    - **Offer Limited Products:** Users are restricted to a small, static lineup of indices.

- The Solution: Infrastructure, Not Just Products.

    💡
    
    ***HyperIndex is not an asset manager; we are the ecosystem. We provide:***
    
    </aside>
    
    > **Single-Token, Multi-Asset Exposure (Core Value):**
    > 
    - Users gain exposure to sectors, themes, or entire markets via a single Index Token minted on HyperEVM.
    
    > **Launcher:**
    > 
    - A permissionless tool where anyone can create, backtest, and mint an Index Token in one click.
    
    > **Index-Only DEX:**
    > 
    - A unified trading venue using a Hybrid Orderbook + AMM model to minimize slippage and ensure deep liquidity.
    
    > **Holder-Owned ETF:**
    > 
    - Each index is governed and rebalanced by its own **DAO**, ensuring decentralized management.

***Why Now?***

- Onchain Index ETF markets are definitely emerging, but on the first early stage
- Index ETFs are first-entering getter market, which means the platform first who gets market cap will dominate the market.

DeFi growth is driven by user autonomy (e.g., Pump.fun). 

> We are building the "Pump.fun for Onchain ETF"—standardizing the infrastructure so creators and traders can drive the market.

### 📊 Market & Competitive Insight

- **Target Market:** Primary target is DeFi traders on **Hyperliquid L1**. We estimate market size by projecting TradFi's ETF growth trends onto the crypto market.
- **Market Trend:** The key driver of DeFi growth is **User Autonomy**. Just as Pump.fun revolutionized memecoins with a "Launchpad + DEX" model, we are building the standard infrastructure for users to create and trade indices themselves, moving away from the centralized "Asset Manager" model.
- **Competition vs. Us:**
    - **Competitors (Index Coop, Reserve):** Act like "Asset Managers."
    - **HyperIndex:** Builds an "Infrastructure Ecosystem."
    - **Our Unfair Advantage:** **Decentralization** (User-participated governance) and **Index-Only Trading Infra** (Hybrid Order Book + AMM).
    
    | **Competitors (Index Coop, Reserve)** | **HyperIndex (Us)** |
    | --- | --- |
    | **1. The "Asset Manager" Model** | **1. The "Infrastructure" Model** |
    | Operates like a centralized fund. The Foundation or DAO acts as a gatekeeper, deciding which indices are created and listed. | Operates as a permissionless ecosystem (like Pump.fun). We provide the tools (Launchpad + DEX), and **users decide** what to create and trade. |
    | **2. Fragmented Trading Infra** | **2. Native Index-Only DEX** |
    | Lacks native trading venues. "Piggybacks" on external DEXs (Curve/Uniswap), resulting in fragmented liquidity, high fees, and no specialized order types. | Built-in **Hybrid Orderbook + AMM** DEX on Hyperliquid. Purpose-built for indices to minimize slippage/spreads and enable sub-second trading with **zero gas**. |
    | **3. Approval-Based Launch** | **3. Permissionless One-Click Launch** |
    | Launching a new index is slow, complex, and requires governance approval. Result: Limited product lineup (<20 active products). | Anyone can launch a tradable index in **one click** with built-in backtesting tools. Enables infinite scalability of diverse strategies and themes. |
    | **4. Passive User Role** | **4. Active Owner & Creator** |
    | Users are limited to "Buying" or "Selling" foundation-issued tokens. No meaningful ownership or revenue share for creators. | Users are **Creators and Governors**. Each index operates as its own **DAO** (Holder-Owned), and creators earn **volume-linked fees**. |

    - **Legal:** Established a sophisticated structure with **Uzbekistan Labs** (Dev) and **Cayman Foundation** (DAO/Token) to ensure compliance.
- **Progress:**
    - **MVP Beta Launch:** Targeted for **November 24** on HyperEVM Mainnet.
    - **Roadmap:** Clear path from Phase 0 (MVP) to Phase 4 (Arbitrage Vaults & Real-Estate Expansion).

### 💰 The Ask & Structure

- **Fundraising:** We are raising a **Pre-seed round of $500K (SAFE)**.
- **Labs Equity Structure:** CEO 66.7%, CTO 17.5%, CFO 10.0%, Leads 5.8%. (Incentives for non-founders reinforced via Token Allocation).
- **Exit Strategy (Unique):**
    1. **Long-term Vision:** Transition the protocol to a complete DAO.
    2. **For VCs:** Liquidity via **TGE (Token Generation Event)** or M&A.
    3. **Ultimate Consolidation:** We aim for **Foundation Holdings** to acquire **Labs Equity** via a **Put Option clause**, ensuring that even the development entity (Labs) eventually belongs to the DAO for complete decentralization.
