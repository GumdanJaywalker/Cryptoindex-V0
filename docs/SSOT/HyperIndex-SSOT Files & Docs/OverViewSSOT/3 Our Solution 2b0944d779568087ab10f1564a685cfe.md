# 3. Our Solution

**Purpose:** To define the product vision, the 4 core value propositions, the 3-layer index universe, and the specific technical reasons for building on Hyperliquid.

---

## 1. One-Liner Definition

<aside>
💡

**"HyperIndex is the decentralized infrastructure for on-chain ETFs (Index Tokens), combining a Launchpad and Index-Only DEX on Hyperliquid L1."**

</aside>

> We are not an asset manager; we are the **ecosystem layer** where anyone can create, trade, and govern index tokens permissionlessly.

## 💎 2. The 4 Core Values

*HyperIndex delivers four distinct values to solve the "Manual Nightmare" of DeFi.*

Demo: 

[YCom_Demo_HyperIndex.mp4](3%20Our%20Solution/YCom_Demo_HyperIndex.mp4)

### **1) Single-Token, Multi-Asset Exposure (Core Value)**

<aside>
💡

**The Solution:** Users gain instant exposure to complex sectors (e.g., "Solana Meme," "RWA," "L1 Blue Chips") by buying a **single Index Token.**

</aside>

> **The Mechanism (SCV):** Each token represents a fully collateralized basket of underlying assets.
> 
> - **Phase 1 (HyperCore):** Operates via **HyperCore**, utilizing existing wrapped assets for immediate, zero-bridge execution .
> - **Phase 2 (Native Vaults):** Expands to **Native Vaults** deployed directly on external chains (e.g., Solana, Base) for direct asset custody .
- **User Benefit:** One click to buy the market. No managing 20 wallets, no bridging gas fees, no manual rebalancing.

### **2) Permissionless Creation (Launcher)**

<aside>
💡

**The Solution:** A "Pump.fun-style" Launcher for financial products. Anyone can create a tradable Index Token in **one click.**

</aside>

> **The Features:**
> 
> - **No Gatekeepers:** Unlike competitors (Index Coop), no governance approval is needed to launch an L3 index.
> - **Leverage:** Supports **Futures Components** to create leveraged index products (up to 10x initially).
> - **Built-in Tools:** Includes backtesting (Sharpe ratio, MDD) and customizable parameters (weights, leverage).
- **User Benefit:** Creators can monetize their insights immediately via **Creator Fees** embedded in the trading volume.

### **3) Index-Only Trading Venue (DEX)**

<aside>
💡

**The Solution:** A dedicated exchange built specifically for Index Tokens, powered by our **HOOATS** (Hybrid Off-Chain Orderbook + AMM Trading System) engine.

</aside>

> **Key Features:**
> 
> - **Hybrid Model:** Combines an **Orderbook** (for tight spreads/limit orders) with an **AMM** (for guaranteed liquidity).
> - **Perpetuals Market:** Includes a native **Perps Market**, allowing users to trade indices with leverage or hedge positions.
> - **NAV Arbitrage:** Facilitates seamless **Creation/Redemption** for institutions to keep prices pegged to NAV.
- **User Benefit:** CEX-grade trading speed (**20k+ TPS**) with minimal slippage and low fees.

### **4) Holder-Owned ETF (Decentralized Governance)**

<aside>
💡

**The Solution:** We don't manage the funds; the **Community** does.

</aside>

> **The Mechanism:** Each Index Token operates as its own **DAO**. Holders vote on rebalancing weights and component changes.
> 
- **User Benefit:** True decentralized ownership. The protocol automates rebalancing based on governance results, removing central points of failure.

## 🌌 3.The Index Universe (3 Layers)

*We organize the chaos of crypto assets into three distinct layers to serve every type of investor.*

| **Layer** | **Description** | **Examples** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Layer 1 (Major)** | **"The Blue Chips."** Large-cap, stable indices representing major market sectors. Rebalanced monthly. | • **Crypto100** (Top 100 MCap)
• **CMC20**
• **RWA** (Real World Assets)
• **AI** (Artificial Intelligence) |
| **Layer 2 (Segmented & VS)** | **"The Trends."** Volatile, narrative-driven themes and "VS Battles." Rebalanced bi-weekly. | • **Dog vs Cat:** Two themes compete; holders vote, winner takes 100% allocation.

• **AI-Data:** Focused AI sub-sector.
• **Sol-Payment:** Solana Pay ecosystem. |
| **Layer 3 (User/Partner)** | **"The Wild West."** Permissionless indices launched by users or partners. High risk, high reward. | • **User Launch:** "My Gem Pick 10"
• **Partner Index:** "Binance24 Trend" or "Photon Trend" (routed from partners). |

## ⚙️ 4. Technical Enabler: Why Hyperliquid?

*Our architecture leverages Hyperliquid L1 for three critical advantages that Ethereum cannot match.*

<aside>
💡

**Seamless Communication (HyperCore <> HyperEVM)**

</aside>

> The strongest advantage is the free and fast communication between HyperCore and HyperEVM.
> 
- **Easy Build:** We build logic easily on HyperEVM while executing orders on HyperCore.
- **Zero-Gas & Speed:** Orders are executed cheaply and instantly.
- **No Bridging:** HyperCore already holds wrapped assets, so we can execute orders without complex, risky cross-chain bridging.

<aside>
💡

**Perps Market Scalability**

</aside>

> Hyperliquid is the home of on-chain perps. Building here allows us to natively integrate Perpetuals into our indices, enabling leveraged products and hedging strategies that are impossible on spot-only chains15.
> 

<aside>
💡

**The Most Active Trader Base**

</aside>

> Hyperliquid users are the most active DeFi traders. By building here, we tap directly into a shared user pool of high-volume traders who understand derivatives and demand CEX-like performance 16.
