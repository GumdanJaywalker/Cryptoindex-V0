# 2. Problem Worth Solving

**Purpose:** To define the market failures, specific user pain points, and the deep structural reasons why the DeFi index market has remained stagnant.

---

## 1. Core Problem Statement

**"DeFi offers infinite assets, but zero efficient infrastructure to manage them."**

---

## 2. The Context: ***Crypto Market is Fragmented, yet Lacks Products***

<aside>
💡

***Crypto Investing is Fragmented, yet DeFi Lacks Structured Products.***

</aside>

> **The Market is Overwhelming.**
> 
- Crypto investing has become unmanageable. Every day, over **50,000 new tokens** are launched across **200+ blockchains**, **120 DEXs**, and **259 CEXs**, each with fragmented liquidity and listings.

> **The "Theme" Gap**
> 
- Traders know the "Theme" (e.g., AI, Meme, RWA) is growing, but they fail to identify *which specific token* among thousands will survive.
- Buying the winner is luck; buying the basket is strategy—but the basket doesn't exist.

> **Structured Product Lakcing in DeFi**
> 
- As the **$17.9T TradFi ETF market** proves, "basketed assets" are key to investment efficiency.
- However, in DeFi, creating a diversified portfolio is painful, because they are forced to build diversified portfolios & manage volatile assets 24/7 manually.

> The Manual Management Pains
> 
- Users must manually buy assets, bridge chains, and rebalance portfolios, incurring high gas fees and operational stress. This results in:
    - **Operational Stress:** Manually buying assets, bridging chains, and tracking prices.
    - **High Costs:** Incurring fees for every single transaction and rebalancing event.

## 3. Pain Points by Persona

### **A-1. For Creators & KOLs: The "Pump & Dump" Trap**

Current meta (Pump.fun) allows easy launching but fails at sustainability.

- **The Dilemma:** To monetize via creator fees, they must launch tokens. But these are often meme coins with no intrinsic value.
- **Loss of Trust:** The moment they sell to realize profits, they hurt their community and lose credibility ("Rug risk").
- **No Long-term Product:** They lack a tool to build **sustainable, asset-backed financial products** that generate recurring revenue (management fees) without destroying their reputation.

### **A-2. For Creators & KOLs: The "Copytrading" Fatigue**

- **Why not Copytrading?** Running a Copytrading account requires **24/7 active management** and high stress to maintain performance (P&L). One bad week can destroy their reputation.
- **The Index Advantage:** Launching an Index Token is **"Set & Manage."** It is a passive, rules-based product.
- **Monetization:** Unlike copytrading (performance fees), Index Creators earn **Volume-Based Fees**. As long as their community trades the index, they earn stable revenue without the pressure of active day-trading.

### **B. For Market Makers (MMs): No Venue to "Make"**

- **Role:** MMs profit from providing liquidity and closing spreads (Arbitrage).
- **The Pain:** Current DeFi index protocols rely on simple AMMs. There is no **Orderbook (CLOB)**, no **Standardized APIs**, and no **fast-settlement** infrastructure. MMs literally have "no venue" to execute professional market-making strategies or Creation/Redemption arbitrage efficiently3.

### **C. For Institutional Investors: No Products to Buy**

- **Role:** Asset Managers and Family Offices want to deploy capital into diversified crypto themes (Beta exposure).
- **The Pain:** The current on-chain ETF market is tiny and barren. There are **no "Blue-chip" index products** with sufficient liquidity or market cap to absorb institutional capital. They are forced to buy single assets or stay in fiat.

### **D. For Retail Traders: The "Manual Nightmare"**

- **Research Hell:** Filtering through 50,000 daily tokens to find non-scams is a full-time job
- **Execution Costs:** Building a simple "Solana Ecosystem" portfolio requires **10+ separate swaps**, paying gas fees and slippage on every single trade.
- **Rebalancing Stress:** To maintain the portfolio, they must manually sell winners and buy losers every month. This triggers tax events, incurs more gas fees, and requires constant monitoring.

## 4. The Root Causes: Why the Market is Broken (Structural Gap)

Why hasn't a dominant "On-chain ETF" emerged yet? It is not just bad execution; it is a deeper structural failure of the current DeFi landscape.

| **Root Cause** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **1. Technical & Economic Barriers** | **High Gas & Fragmentation:** Existing indices are expensive to rebalance and mostly limited to Ethereum Mainnet. There is no "Standard" for cross-chain index tokens.  |
| **2. Structural & Governance Problems** | **Centralized & Static:** Indices are managed like "Mini-Asset Managers" (TradFi style), not DAOs. They are slow to react to new trends (e.g., AI, Memes) and offer static, boring product lines.  |
| **3. Social & Cultural Failures** | **No "Playground" Element:** Existing platforms feel like a "Catalog," not a "Market." They lack the viral, community-driven engagement (memetic growth) that drives DeFi today. Users have no reason to participate beyond holding.  |

---

## 5. Competitor Analysis: The "Phenomena"

*(How these root causes manifest in current players)*

> **Existing Solutions are Flawed.**
> 

Current competitors (e.g., Index Coop, Reserve) operate as centralized **"Asset Managers"** rather than open infrastructure. They fail to solve the problem because they:

- **Act as Gatekeepers:** Centralized governance limits who can launch an index, manage a index and delist it from platform.
- **Lack Trading Infrastructure:** Relying on external DEXs causes high slippage, fees & de-concentration because they diluted into all other tokens. Or they only provide create <> redemption of each ETF units, which basically are not trading infra.
- **Offer Limited Products:** Users are restricted to a small, static lineup of indices.

| **Competitor** | **Why They Are Failing (Phenomena)** | **What they are good (Among Competitors)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Index Coop** | • **Bureaucracy:** 
Launches are protocol-led and slow. No permissionless creation.

• **Weak Infra:** 
Piggybacks on Uniswap; no native trading engine.

• **Limited number of Products:** 
Less than 10 | - |
| **Reserve (DTFs)** | • **Yield Focus:** 
Focuses on "Stable/Dividend" baskets, not active themes which gives price exposure of baskets.

• **Ghost Town:** 
Even top products like ETH+ see negligible daily volume ($640k) due to lack of trading features.

• **High Concentration:** 
3 of their products (ETH+, bsdETH, USD3) covers 96.2% of their product line market cap.

• **Governed by Native Token:**
 Each of their index baksets are governed by “$RSR” their native tokens, not tokens of each index.

• **Weak Infra:** 
Piggybacks on panckaeswap

• **Limited number of Products:** 
Less than 20 | **The best one so far. The most direct competitor.**
- Has Strong Product line in Yield ETFs. ($250M+ MCap)
- Started launching Index Focus ETFs too recently, via realizing the exisitng Major Statistic Firm’s Indexes.
e.g. CMC20 / CF Large Cap Index

- It Seems goood way to get attention like this. First using large providers to provide our index tokens, and emerging market with competitor against Reserve. |
| **SSI** | • **Centralized:** 
Operated entirely by the foundation.

• **Incomplete:** 
Supports Mint/Burn but lacks a secondary DEX, making it just a "Vending Machine" rather than a market.

• **Limited number of Products:** 
Less than 5 | **Second Best one so far. 
-** Has Strong market attention (marketing succeed) on Chinese markets.

- Former Platform for data analytics, currently providing own index. |
